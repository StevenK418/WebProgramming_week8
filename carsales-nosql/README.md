## Developer Notes
=> Various changes had to be be made from the worksheet. 
    => Certain snippets of code would not work as shown and prevented compilation. 
    => As a result, I have replaced them with the current modern equivalent. 

=> Additional features
    => I have added bootstrap to the project for improved Layout and design. 
    => HTML has been styled using Bootstrap classes only in order to improve usability and aesthetic. 
    => Firestore date rul has been added as requested. 
    => (IMPORTANT: Environments directive in app.module.ts and main.ts had to be updated to use environments.prod explicitly as firebase project would not compile after NPM install otherwise.)
