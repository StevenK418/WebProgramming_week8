CA4 for my Web Programming module as part of my Bsc Hons in Computing at IT Sligo.

## Github Details
=> Repository: https://github.com/StevenK418/WebProgramming_week8
=> Git clone:   https://github.com/StevenK418/WebProgramming_week8.git

## Firebase Details: 
=> The live app is hosted on Firebase
    => The App may be accessed here: https://s00200293-stevenkelly-carsales.web.app/ 

## Developer Notes
=> Various changes had to be be made from the worksheet. 
    => Certain snippets of code would not work as shown and prevented compilation. 
    => As a result, I have replaced them with the current modern equivalent. 

=> Additional features
    => I have added bootstrap to the project for improved Layout and design. 
    => HTML has been styled using Bootstrap classes only in order to improve usability and aesthetic. 
    => Firestore date rul has been added as requested.
